This repository groups different small bioinformatics projects that I developed:

- Sequence alignment in C and Python
- Kmers and Codon computing from FASTA sequences in C
- SLURM supercomputer scripts for sequence preprocessing and mapping
- R scripts for Differential Expression analysis using DESEQ2
