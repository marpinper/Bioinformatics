This code has been developed to compute k-mers, dinucleotides and
codons of a sequence in FASTA format using the k (number of
k-mers, which will be 2 for dinucleotides) and the sequence file name.
Additional code developed in C and Python computes a dictionary
from the sequence in order to compare different dictionaries and establish similarities.
These results have been used to draw conclusions about the sequences
studied.
